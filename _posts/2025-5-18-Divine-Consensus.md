Divine Consensus: The Universal Thread

Divine consensus is the thing which all religions share, which all scientists share, which all experiences of life share—shared with every creature which can see, hear, know, or feel; shared with everything that is as it is.

Divine consensus is the consensus of each of our place where we are, and has been plagued—and perhaps corrupted—by rationality. Rationalizations more so, which allow us to exist as we ought not to be, with the full comprehension of our wrong choices, feeling justified in our pursuit of an alternate path from that which we know—or at least are aware—to be the common and well-trodden one.

This comes in many ways. Most of liberalism exists to test these boundaries, and the constant discourse of our species is to allow us to change through these various perspectives. And this is instantaneous consensus.

Divine consensus unites all instantaneous potential and is captured best by many of the religions that have come before us, the common ideas that they share, and the common lineage of the thought that they unknowingly continue with.

In many ways, every religion and every purpose comes from the same conversation between two people about a world that could be, and how to achieve it.

And there's something that we feel when we close our eyes and think, or when we can feel our divine intuition—our rational purpose before us. It is that same voice that tells us what could not be. It is this that we do not understand, which we call God. It is the unknowable consequence of so many actions leading to the instantiation of your current existence, of the way that you are at this moment, every moment.

And it is always beautiful.

The excitement of divine consensus, however, is for some the simplicity and accessibility of the simpleness. And for many others, however, it is the overwhelming and all-encompassing splashes as new divine consensus is created, as new shifts occur and allow people to see further—and the invitation to pursue this incredible perspective with others.

But as so many lemmings jumping off a cliff, we never know if these splashes will be worth it.

And now, with the final consequence of the finite space of our planet, we are faced with a great choice.

Shall we yield to the obvious things before us—to the things we see when we close our eyes that tell us exactly where we are? The things that we don't need to rationalize?

Should we live in that world, or should we try to rationalize new worlds?
