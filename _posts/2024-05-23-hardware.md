The rapid development of distributed hardware technology offers a unique opportunity to reshape social systems and economic orders. By financing the distribution of computers and phones, we can integrate large groups of people into the global online community, enabling them to host goods and services using their devices. This model promises broader opportunities and access to innovative online systems.

### Revenue Generation and Cost Reduction

Distributed networks provide numerous immediate benefits, such as generating revenue during idle times (e.g., overnight). By leveraging mesh networks for services like proxy and caching, devices can perform tasks traditionally handled by centralized systems. This decentralization reduces costs and improves access, enabling more individuals to participate in the digital economy.

#### Applications in Blockchain and Collaborative Networks

Blockchain networks can incorporate small validators, facilitating tasks like DIDs and ZK rollup verifications on small devices. Similarly, collaborative networks such as Warpcast, Steemit, and Mastodon require numerous hosting nodes, which can be efficiently managed by distributed devices. This approach ensures that devices generate sufficient revenue over their lifespan to cover their costs, allowing for subsidized distribution.

### Expanding Access and Participation

By distributing high-grade hardware to billions who currently lack access, we can significantly expand digital participation. Starting with mobile devices and extending to small home devices like Raspberry Pi, these devices can serve dual purposes, acting as entertainment consoles and network routers. Participants can receive free services like VPNs in exchange for hosting, further offsetting their costs.

### Investment Challenges and Opportunities

Launching such networks requires significant infrastructure investment. While traditional liquidity providers may be hesitant due to the unproven nature of distributed hosting, advancements in Web3 technologies make these networks increasingly viable. Tokenized networks, with their growing utility and capacity, offer promising initial revenue sources.

### Conclusion

The potential of distributed hardware to revolutionize our social and economic landscapes is immense. By reducing costs and improving access through decentralized networks, we can foster innovation and inclusivity. With the right investment, we can bring billions into the digital economy, transforming interactions and building resilient, inclusive communities.
