## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Front Matter Validation Risk

_File: `_posts/*.md`_

```yaml
---
title: <potential XSS vector>
layout: post
---
```

**Issue**: Unvalidated front matter could potentially allow metadata injection, exposing the site to cross-site scripting (XSS) risks.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement strict front matter validation middleware
- Create a sanitization function for front matter inputs
- Use Jekyll plugins like `jekyll-data` for enhanced validation
- Implement server-side input sanitization

### [2] Dependency Security Concerns

_File: `Gemfile`_

**Issue**: Potential outdated dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Run `bundle audit` to identify vulnerable gems
- Regularly update dependencies
- Pin specific versions with confirmed security patches
- Set up automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Performance Anti-Patterns

### [1] Large Asset Imports

_File: `_sass/bootstrap-sass/bootstrap.scss`_

**Issue**: Comprehensive Bootstrap import increases build time and asset size.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement modular imports of Bootstrap components
- Use asset tree-shaking techniques
- Create a custom Bootstrap build with only required components
- Minimize CSS/JS bundle sizes through selective imports

### [2] Inefficient Static Asset Loading

_File: `_includes/scripts.html`_

**Issue**: Non-optimized script and stylesheet loading impacting page performance.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Add `async` and `defer` attributes to non-critical scripts
- Implement critical CSS inlining
- Leverage browser caching with appropriate cache headers
- Use resource hints like `preload` for critical assets

## Maintainability Concerns

### [1] Inconsistent Layout Inheritance

_File: `_layouts/`_

**Issue**: Multiple layout files with potential redundancy and complex inheritance.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Consolidate layout templates
- Create more modular, reusable layout components
- Implement a clear, hierarchical layout structure
- Document layout inheritance and usage guidelines

### [2] Manual Content Management

_File: `_posts/`_

**Issue**: Inconsistent post front matter and manual formatting.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Create standardized front matter templates
- Implement content linting tools
- Develop a comprehensive markdown style guide
- Use Git hooks to enforce content formatting standards

## Deployment Considerations

### [1] GitHub Pages Limitations

_File: `_config.yml`_

**Issue**: Potential build complexity exceeding GitHub Pages capabilities.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Keep Jekyll configuration minimal and GitHub-compatible
- Use only GitHub-supported plugins
- Develop alternative build strategies
- Consider using GitHub Actions for more complex build processes

## Conclusion

This audit reveals moderate security risks, performance optimization opportunities, and maintainability improvements for the Econ3.org Jekyll blog. By systematically addressing these findings, the development team can enhance the project's security, performance, and long-term sustainability.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Conduct a comprehensive dependency security audit
2. Implement front matter validation mechanisms
3. Optimize static asset loading and imports
4. Refactor layout and include structures
5. Establish ongoing code quality and security review processes
