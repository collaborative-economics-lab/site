## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Unpinned GitHub Pages Dependency
_File: Gemfile_

```ruby
gem "github-pages", ">= 25"
```

**Risk**: Unspecified gem version could introduce unknown security vulnerabilities.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Pin to a specific, verified version
- Example: `gem "github-pages", "= 228"`
- Regularly update dependencies through controlled processes

### [2] Missing Content Security Policy
_File: _config.yml_

**Risk**: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of CSP.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement Content Security Policy via HTTP headers
- Add CSP meta tags in `_includes/head.html`
- Restrict script and resource loading to trusted domains

### [3] External Script Integrity Vulnerability
_Files: _includes/scripts.html, javascripts/*_

**Risk**: Scripts loaded without integrity checks, potential for script tampering.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Add `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes to script tags
- Use versioned, verified CDN resources
- Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks

## Performance Concerns

### [1] Unoptimized JavaScript Bundles
_Files: javascripts/bootstrap.min.js, javascripts/jquery.min.js_

**Risk**: Large minified scripts without clear versioning, potential performance overhead.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use versioned CDN links
- Implement asset fingerprinting
- Consider lazy loading non-critical scripts

### [2] Inefficient Jekyll Build Configuration
_File: _config.yml_

**Risk**: Potentially slow site generation with growing content.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Enable incremental builds
- Limit post generation
- Optimize Jekyll configuration for performance

## Maintainability Issues

### [1] Hardcoded URL Configuration
_File: _config.yml_

```yaml
url: "http://ellekasai.github.io"
baseurl: "/"
```

**Risk**: Reduced deployment portability, environment inflexibility.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use environment variables
- Create separate configuration files for different environments
- Implement dynamic URL resolution

### [2] Future-Dated Content Management
_Folder: _posts/_

**Risk**: Potential content generation and management complications.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Remove or validate future-dated posts
- Implement strict date validation in build process
- Use Jekyll's built-in future post handling

## Accessibility & SEO

### [1] Incomplete Metadata Configuration
_File: _includes/head.html_

**Risk**: Poor search engine indexing and accessibility.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Add comprehensive meta tags
- Include description, Open Graph, and Twitter Card metadata
- Ensure semantic HTML structure

## Severity Summary
- High Risk Issues: 2
- Medium Risk Issues: 3
- Low Risk Issues: 2

## Recommendations
1. Update dependencies to specific, secure versions
2. Implement Content Security Policy
3. Add Subresource Integrity for external scripts
4. Optimize build and asset management
5. Enhance metadata and accessibility configurations
