- [Deployment Risks](#deployment-risks)

## Overview
This security audit identifies critical vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability risks in the project. The analysis covers dependency management, configuration exposure, and potential security vectors.

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Unspecific Dependency Versioning
_File: Gemfile_
```ruby
gem "github-pages", ">= 25"
```

**Risk**: Using an open-ended version constraint allows potentially untrusted or incompatible gem versions.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Pin to a specific, verified version
- Use: `gem "github-pages", "= 228"`
- Implement regular dependency audits

### [2] Configuration Information Exposure
_File: _config.yml_
```yaml
url: "http://ellekasai.github.io"
```

**Risk**: 
- Exposing full GitHub Pages URL
- Using insecure HTTP protocol
- Potential information disclosure

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use HTTPS
- Consider implementing a custom domain
- Remove unnecessary configuration details

## Performance Issues

### [1] Redundant JavaScript Loading
_Files: 
- javascripts/jquery.min.js
- javascripts/bootstrap.min.js_

**Risk**: 
- Multiple library inclusions
- Increased page load time
- Potential performance overhead

**Suggested Fix**:
- Consolidate scripts
- Implement tree-shaking
- Use modern module bundling techniques

### [2] Future-Dated Content Management
_Folder: _posts/_

**Risk**:
- Posts with future dates (e.g., 2025-5-07-prometheus.md)
- Potential build process inconsistencies
- Unnecessary content generation

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement content validation in build process
- Remove or draft future-dated posts
- Add CI checks for post metadata

## Maintainability Concerns

### [1] Complex SCSS Organization
_Folder: _sass/bootstrap-sass/_

**Risk**:
- Nested, complex Bootstrap SCSS
- Reduced code readability
- Potential maintenance challenges

**Suggested Fix**:
- Create a custom SCSS overlay
- Implement clear namespacing
- Simplify import structure

## Deployment Risks

### [1] Limited Plugin Compatibility
_File: _config.yml_
```yaml
gems:
  - jemoji
```

**Risk**:
- Restricted to GitHub Pages plugin whitelist
- Potential limitations in site functionality

**Suggested Fix**:
- Validate all plugins against GitHub Pages requirements
- Consider alternative deployment strategies
- Maintain a lean plugin ecosystem

## Severity and Prioritization

| Priority | Category | Issues |
|----------|----------|--------|
| High | Dependency Management | Unspecific versioning |
| Medium | Configuration | URL exposure |
| Low | Performance | JavaScript loading |

## Recommended Actions
1. Update Gemfile with strict versioning
2. Implement content validation scripts
3. Optimize asset loading
4. Review and standardize post metadata
5. Conduct regular security audits

## Conclusion
This audit reveals several areas for improvement in security, performance, and maintainability. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential risks and enhance overall project quality.
